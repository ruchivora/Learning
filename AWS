How do you get automatic Notification if your bill goes over $1000 ?
- You get alarm using "Cloud Watch"
- You go to cloud watch and create "Billing Alarm"
- Billing Alarm uses SNS Topic
- SNS Topic is a way of emaittps://crontab.guling you when
  your bill goes above $1000

IAM - Identity Access Management 
 - IAM allows you to create users,
 - it allows you to create groups
 - and it allows you to create roles.
 - And basically it's a way of you being able
 - to give access to AWS to your different users and groups.

IAM Credential Reports
 - you can generate and download a credential report that lists
 - all of the users in your account in terms of what it show in terms of
 - passwords.
 - It will show whether a password is enabled when the password was last used when
 - it was last changed and when it must next be changed similarly with access
 - keys, which is basically like a password

What is S3? 
 - S3 stands for simple storage service.
 - It's a place to put your flat files. So things like videos,
 - things like text files, things like pictures,
 - basically any kind of flat file can be stored.
 - So you couldn't store a database file on S3 because database file is always
 - changing, but if it's a flat file, like a picture or a video, for example,
 - that's been already been encoded, then it is a perfect candidate for S3.
 
What is S3 bucket?
 - A bucket is a folder in the cloud and buckets
 - basically share a universal namespace.
 - And that just means that their name must be unique globally.(Like IP Address)
 - you're always going to receive a HTTP 200 code if the upload was
 - successful. 
 - So S3 is a key value store.
 - You've got a key, which is the file name, and then the value,
 - which is the actual data.
 
How does data consistency for S3 work?
 - So we have two things.
 - We have a read after write consistency for puts of new objects,
 - and then we have eventual consistency for overwrite puts and deletes and this
 - can take some time to propagate.

What is "read after write consistency for puts of new objects" ?
 - If you are writing a new file,
 - which is basically you're putting a new file into S3 and then
 - you read it immediately , you will be able to view that data.
 - So if I upload a file, that's just says, hello, cloud gurus.TXT.
 - Soon as I upload that, I'll immediately be able to read that data.
 - So that's puts of new objects.

What is "eventual consistency for overwrite puts and deletes" ?
 - So if I upload a new file called hello, cloud gurus,
 - and in it I made changes say, hello, cloud gurus two,
 - and then I immediately access that, then
 - I might be reading the new file or I might be reading the old file.
 - And the reason for that is it can take some time for objects to propagate
 - amongst S3. Likewise,
 - if I delete a file and then try and read it immediately afterwards,
 - I still may be able to access that file.

What are the different S3 storage classes ?
 - S3 standard
 - S3 infrequently accessed
 - S3 zone, infrequently access.
    -- So this is where you want a lower cost solution and you don't need multiple
    -- availability zones.
 - S3, intelligent tiering
    -- uses machine learning to move your data around the different storage
    -- classes
 - S3 Glacier 
    -- This is a secure, durable,
    -- low cost storage class for data archiving and your retrieval times are
    -- always configurable between minutes
 - Glacier Deep Archive,
    -- Here the retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.
    
What is S3 versioning?
 - This basically allows you to
 - keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket.
 - You can preserve versions too.
 - You can use versioning to preserve,
 - retrieve and restore different versions of your bucket.
 
What is CloudFront?
 - CloudFront is Amazon's content delivery network or CDN,
 - and a content delivery network is a system of distributed servers or network
 - that delivers webpages and other web content to a user based on their
 - geographical locations of the user.
 
How does the content is dilivered without CDN ? 
 - So let's say we've got a file server.
 - It's sitting in London and it has a video file on it and let's say that file is
 - about one or two gigs in size. So it's quite a large file.
 - I've got our users from all over the world from North America, South America,
 - South Africa, Australia,
 - and India and they want to watch this video and the way they do it is they
 - connect into London and they pull that video down and it can take an awful lot
 - of time depending on where they are, depending on their connection speeds
 - and it can be quite a slow process.
 - So we have these things called CDN networks and they make the whole process a
 - lot faster.
 
To understand the working of CDN , we need to know
 - Edge locations : there's always more edge locations
   than there are regions and this is basically the location where content will be
   cached.So this is where we cache our content and this is separate to an AWS region
   or availability zone. 
   
 - Origin : This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute.
   So this normally will be an S3 bucket,
   but it could also be an EC2 instance or an elastic load balancer,
   or even Route 53. 
   
 - Distributions : This is actually the name given to the
   CDN, which consists of a collection of edge locations.
   
How CloudFront or ContentDeliveryNetwork Work ?
 - We've got our origin, which is our S3 bucket,
 - and that's where our files are sitting.
 - So that's where our large video files of over a gig in size.
 - We then have our users spread all over the world. Now,
 - if CloudFront is turned on, this is what happens.
 - Our users will first query the edge location and they will basically say,
 - Hey, do you have a copy of this file? I really, really want to watch this video,
 - but it's about a gig in size. Now, the edge locations,
 - because this is the first user that's ever queried that a file,
 - the edge locations will not have a copy.
 - And what they'll do is they'll connect to the origin and they'll download the
 - file to the edge location and the edge of the file is stored at that
 - edge location and is then streamed to the user.
 - Then when a second user comes in and queries the same file,
 - that file is already cached at the edge location and that
 - second user doesn't have to then download it from the origin.
 - It doesn't have to then be downloaded from the S3 bucket in London.
 - They can actually get it from an edge location nearest them.
 - So in America or in South South America or South Africa or Australia,
 - or in India or Singapore, APAC region, et cetera, et cetera.
 - So that's how CloudFront and CDNs work.
 - The first user is always going get that added latency.
 - And the file is cached for a number of a length of time called TTL which is 48 hours
 
What is RDS?
 - Relational Databases on AWS is called RDS.
 - You can deploy your RDS instance across
 - multiple Availability Zones.
 - This is designed for Disaster Recovery.
 
What is Read Replicas in AWS ?
 - Read Replicas are literally copies
 - of your production database.
 - And, basically, you send your EC2 instances
 - to read traffic from your Read Replicas
 - rather than from your production database
 - because performing write on a database freezes the database for some time,
 - so that it doesn't have a performance hit.
 - So, Read Replicas are for performance
 - and Multi-AvailablityZone is for Disaster Recovery. 

What is DynamoDB ?
 - This is Amazon's NoSQL solution. So if you have
   a NoSQL requirement, you want to use DynamoDB.
  
What is Redshift ?
 - Redshift is Amazon's Data Warehousing solution.
 - This is used for Online Analytics Processing
 - and this is basically if you got Business Intelligence tools
 - or you've got management wanting to make
 - really complex queries.
 - You want them to be querying Redshift,
 - you don't want them to be querying RDS,
 - so, you don't want them to be querying MySQL
 - or MariaDB or PostgreSQL.
 
What is Route53 ?
 - It is Amazon's DNS service.
 - DNS works on port 53
 - with the Route 53,you can use it to direct traffic all around the world.
